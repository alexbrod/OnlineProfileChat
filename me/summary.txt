Me and my wife have 3 awesome sons, which I am proud of.
I love challanges, intersting problems, riddles. 
I love create, imagine something and then implement it, both in software development but other things like wood work, love creative thinking, solving things out side the box.
In my free time i like playing PC/PS games or chess, I really into sports, like football, swimming pingpong, and others.
